I'm am a Software Engineer at [Supedio GmbH](https://supedio.com){:target="\_blank"} working on Master Data Management and Medical Entity Resolution. I completed my Bachelors in Information Technology and Mathematics from [Cluster Innovation Centre](https://ducic.ac.in){:target="\_blank"}, [University of Delhi](https://du.ac.in){:target="\_blank"} in July 2021.

I have previously interned with the research team at [DRDO, Govt. of India](https://www.drdo.gov.in/home){:target="\_blank"}, where I worked on an Image Segmentation task in a simulated Gazebo environment. I spent a summer at [Chennai Mathematical Institute](https://www.cmi.ac.in/){:target="\_blank"} as a Mathematical Finance Summer Scholar, working on sliding-window approaches. I have also interned with the Data Science team at [Cronycle, UK](https://cronycle.com){:target="\_blank"}, building a production-ready RSS aggregating pipeline.

I'm mostly interested in working in **Deep Learning**, **NLP** and it's applications in **Computational Social Science**. Presently, I am modeling polite requests and tinkering with **conversational agents**. I have also worked on Suicide Risk Assessment on Social Media, Keyphrase Extraction, and processing invoices.
