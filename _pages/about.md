I'm a Research Fellow (Pre-Doctoral) at [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/){:target="\_blank"} with the [PROSE](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/prose/){:target="\_blank"} group, where I am working on Last-Mile Repair in low-code applications, advised by [Dr. Vu Le](https://www.vuminhle.com/).
I completed my Bachelors in Information Technology and Mathematics from [Cluster Innovation Centre](https://ducic.ac.in){:target="\_blank"}, [University of Delhi](https://du.ac.in){:target="\_blank"} in 2021.
I'm broadly interested in working on **Deep Learning**, **Natural Language Processing/Understanding** and it's applications in **Programming Languages** and **Computational Social Science**.

I spent a summer at [Chennai Mathematical Institute](https://www.cmi.ac.in/){:target="\_blank"} as a Mathematical Finance Summer Scholar, working on sliding-window approaches for finding alpha.
I have also interned with the Data Science team at [Cronycle, UK](https://cronycle.com){:target="\_blank"}, building a production-ready RSS aggregating pipeline.
