I'm a first-year CS PhD student at **Stanford University** with the **StanfordNLP** group.
I completed my Bachelors in IT and Mathematics from Cluster Innovation Centre, [University of Delhi](https://du.ac.in){:target="\_blank"} in 2021.
I'm broadly interested in working on **Neuro-symbolic Workflows for LLMs**, **Natural Language Processing** and it's applications in **Conversational Assistants** and **Computational Social Science**.

Previously, I was a Research Fellow at **Microsoft Research** with the [PROSE](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/prose/){:target="\_blank"} group, where I worked on Program Repair and Formula Intelligence in Excel spreadsheets, advised by **Dr. Jos√© Cambronero** and **Dr. Vu Le**.
I have been a Research Software Engineer at **Supedio GmbH** working on Master Data Management, Medical Entity Resolution and Text Extraction from PDFs.
I have interned with the research team at **DRDO, Govt. of India**, where I worked on an Image Segmentation task in a simulated Gazebo environment.
I spent a summer at **Chennai Mathematical Institute** as a Mathematical Finance Summer Scholar, working on sliding-window approaches for finding abnormal rate of returns.
I have also interned with the Data Science team at **Cronycle Ltd., UK**, building a production-ready RSS aggregating pipeline. In the summer of 2018, I was a student developer with **Google Summer of Code**.

I have also had the good fortune to work with Prof. Monica Lam, Prof. Diyi Yang, Dr. Sumit Gulwani, Dr. Aditya Kanade, Dr. Rajiv Ratn Shah, Dr. Lucie Flek and Dr. Alicia Nobles.
