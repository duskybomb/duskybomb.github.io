I'm a first-year CS PhD student at **Stanford University** with the **StanfordNLP** group.
Currently, I am rotating with Prof. Monica Lam and working on conversational assistants.
I completed my Bachelors in IT and Mathematics from Cluster Innovation Centre, [University of Delhi](https://du.ac.in){:target="\_blank"} in 2021.
I'm broadly interested in working on **Neuro-symbolic methods**, **Natural Language Processing** and it's applications in **Program Synthesis** and **Computational Social Science**.

Previously, I was a Research Fellow at Microsoft Research with the [PROSE](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/prose/){:target="\_blank"} group, where I worked on Program Repair and Formula Intelligence in Excel spreadsheets, advised by [Dr. Jos√© Cambronero](https://www.josecambronero.com/) and [Dr. Vu Le](https://www.vuminhle.com/).
I have been a Research Software Engineer at [Supedio GmbH](https://supedio.com){:target="\_blank"} working on Master Data Management, Medical Entity Resolution and Text Extraction from PDFs.
I have interned with the research team at [DRDO, Govt. of India](https://www.drdo.gov.in/home){:target="\_blank"}, where I worked on an Image Segmentation task in a simulated Gazebo environment.
I spent a summer at [Chennai Mathematical Institute](https://www.cmi.ac.in/){:target="\_blank"} as a Mathematical Finance Summer Scholar, working on sliding-window approaches for finding abnormal rate of returns.
I have also interned with the Data Science team at [Cronycle, UK](https://cronycle.com){:target="\_blank"}, building a production-ready RSS aggregating pipeline. In the summer of 2018, I was a student developer with [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/){:target="\_blank}.
